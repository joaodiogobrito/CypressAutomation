# CypressAutomation

Hi,
This is an Automation Testing project created in Cypress.
It tests Footer Links functionality and respective URL, the Sports Links functionality and respective URL,
select a match and veify new browser is opened, user logs in and out correctly and adding a favorite league
respetive user.
Due to intuite nature of Cypress it took me just one day to create this framework. Netherless it needs some
already tracked improvements. It is a work in progress.
