# CypressAutomation

Hi,

This is an Automation Testing project created in Cypress.

It tests Footer Links functionality and respective URL, the Sports Links functionality and respective URL,
select a match and veify new browser is opened, user logs in and out correctly and adding a favorite league
respetive user.

Due to intuite nature of Cypress it took me just one day to create this framework. Nevertheless it needs some
already tracked improvements. It is a work in progress.
